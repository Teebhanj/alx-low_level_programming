MAKEFILES


A makefile is used to automatically determine which piece of large program needs to be recompiled, and issues the command to recompile them.

Rule

A simple makefile consist of 'rules' with the following shape

target ...: prerequisites ...
	recipe
	...
	...

A target is usually the name of a file that is generated by a prgram; examples of targets are executable or object files.

A prerequisite is a file that is used as input to create the target. A target often depends on several files.

A recipe is an action that make carries out. A recipe may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its own line. Please note: you need to put a tab character at the beginning of every recipe line! This is an obscurity that catches the unwary. If you prefer to prefix your recipes with a character other than tab, you can set the .RECIPEPREFIX variable to an alternate character

A rule, then, explains how and when to remake certain files which are the targets of the particular rule. make carries out the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target. A rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action.

A makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile need only contain rules. Rules may look somewhat more complicated than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more or less.
